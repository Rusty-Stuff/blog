TL;DR: Rebrand from Rusty Forms to Formshive, with a new name and logo.

## Rebranding

We're excited to announce our rebrand from Rusty Forms to **Formshive**!

We think of your forms as a hive of activity, where data is collected, sorted and forwarded as needed.
This inspired us to create a new name and logo that reflects this idea.

## Changes

For now, there's nothing you have to do; Everything will continue to work as before.

For new forms:
- The website URL will change from `https://rusty-forms.com` to `https://formshive.com`
- The form URL will change from `https://api.rusty-forms.com` to `https://api.formshive.com`

Emails now come from `support@formshive.cm`, so please update your email filters accordingly.
