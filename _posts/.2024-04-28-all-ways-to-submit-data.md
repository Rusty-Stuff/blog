## Post forms via JS/TS from Vue, React and others

Sometimes what you need is a little bit more control over the form submission. Here's how you can post forms with files, from your favorite front-end framework:

```js
// Fill your fields as desired
public form = {
  title: '',
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  email: '',
  message: '',
}

// Capture the file
file: File | null = null

// Trigger to submit the form
async submit() {
  const formData = new FormData()
  if (this.file) {
    formData.append('file', this.file)
  }
  for (const key in this.form) {
    formData.append(key, (this.form as any)[key])
  }

  const response = await fetch('https://api.rusty-forms.com/v1/digest/821f4a10-127c-46c6-bc80-8790d219575a', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    redirect: 'manual'
  });

  // Handle the response as desired
}
```

Unlike [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/3924), `fetch` also handles redirects properly, so you can grab this from the `response` object:

```json
{
  type: "opaqueredirect",
  url: "https://api.rusty-forms.com/v1/digest/821f4a10-127c-46c6-bc80-8790d219575a",
  redirected: true,
  status: 302,
  ok: false,
  statusText: "",
  headers: Headers(0),
  body: null,
  bodyUsed: false
}
```
