TL;DR: Massively improved usability, added embedded forms and form-links.

## Visual Form Editor

We're happy to introduce our new, much simplified Visual Editor!

What changes:
- There's new fields for Email, Phone number and Url
- You can easily re-arrange fields
- The 3-column layout gives you a better overview
