TL;DR: The preview release of Rusty Shops is now available.

I'm excited to announce the preview release of Rusty Shops, a simple yet powerful way to sell your products online.

## Features

- Add warehouses to sell from multiple locations
- Add products with images, descriptions, and prices
- Automatically calculate sales tax selling locally and internationally
- Easily customize shipping fees and providers, and offer free shipping for orders over a certain amount
