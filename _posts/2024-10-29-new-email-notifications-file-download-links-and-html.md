TL;DR: Email notifications now include temporary download links for attachments and are sent in both plain text and HTML formats.

I'm excited to announce two highly requested improvements to our email notifications:

1. Attachment Download Links:
   Email notifications now include a direct download link for file attachments. This allows you to access files without leaving your email client. These links are valid for 24 hours. After expiration, you can still download files through the Rusty Forms website as usual.

2. Dual-Format Emails:
   We now send all notifications in both plain text and HTML formats. While we prefer the simplicity of plain text, the HTML version makes it easier to open your form or download attachments with a single click.

Key Updates:
- Temporary (24-hour) download links for attachments in email notifications
- Email notifications sent in both plain text and HTML formats for improved accessibility
