TL;DR: Massively improved usability, added embedded forms and form-links.

## Usability Improvements

Easier login and new color scheme.

- Confusing phrases like "Magic link" are now "Email link"
- The new color scheme is more consistent and easier on the eyes

## New Settings Page

Formoxy comes with a lot of features, and striking the balance between making it accessible to novices, and powerful for experts can be tricky. Clearer wording, better tooltips, and a improved layout should help with that.

- Totally re-worked the forms page
- New option to embed forms (via iframe, with script, or as link)
- Embedded forms can be blank, or themed with Bulma or Bootstrap
- Adding new form fields is easier now (with clear description what field types mean)
- Fields with multiple options are easier to edit

Editing form fields is still confusing the first time, but improvements are coming soon.
